# Email Spam Detection Project

## Overview
Spam emails, often characterized by cryptic messages, scams, or phishing content, pose a significant challenge to email users. This project aims to develop an email spam detector using Python and machine learning techniques. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the detector will be trained to classify emails into spam and non-spam categories, thereby enhancing email security and user experience.

## Approach
1. **Data Collection**: Gather a dataset consisting of both spam and non-spam emails.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the email data, including text normalization and feature extraction.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Extract relevant features from the email content, such as word frequencies, to feed into the machine learning model.
4. **Model Selection**: Experiment with various classification algorithms, such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forests.
5. **Model Training**: Train the selected model using the preprocessed email data.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Assess the performance of the trained model using evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
7. **Deployment**: Deploy the trained spam detector to classify incoming emails in real-time.

## Usage
